lua Release Notes
=================

Release 2-0
-----------

-  "iocsh" library now available for any version of base
-  Calls to the "iocsh" library can omit the library name while within
   the luash interpreter, this makes the luash almost fully backwards
   compatible with iocsh scripts. The only problems come from comments
   (due to "#" being a command in lua) and macros being different than
   global variables.
-  Better error handling in "asyn" library
-  lua Script file location now allows full paths
-  loadRegistered function automatically triggered and no longer needed
   for lua startup scripts
-  Lua static library registration now setup to work with standard lua
   "require" functionality
-  'asyn' lua library function "port" changed to "client" to better
   represent that it is creating an asynOctetClient not an
   asynPortDriver. InTerminator and OutTerminator changed to member
   fields rather than get/set functions.
-  'asyn' lua library new function "driver" creates an object
   representing an asynPortDriver. Allows you to get/set the value of
   parameters in the paramList and trigger the read and write functions
   of parameters.
-  Parameters supplied in luaRecord CODE field and macros provided to
   luaSpawn are now evaluated using a lua sandbox environment rather
   than a custom parser.
