The following are additional functions added to the lua runtime interpreter to 
enable access to the epics runtime environment.

	terminator [string]   - The string value to wait for when reading from an
	                        asyn port.

	                        to wait before failure.


**asyn.getWriteTimeout** ()
	
	Returns the value of the global variable WriteTimeout
							
	

**asyn.setReadTimeout** (*timeout*)

	Sets the global variable ReadTimeout, which controls asyn read commands
	
	
	timeout   [number]    - The number of milliseconds for an asyn read command
	                        to wait before failure.


**asyn.getReadTimeout** ()
	
	Returns the value of the global variable ReadTimeout
							
	

**asyn.write** (*data, portName, addr*)

	Write a string to a given asynOctet port
	
	
	data      [string]    - The string to write to the port. This string will 
	                        automatically have the value of the global variable
	                        OutTerminator appended to it.

	portName   [string]   - A registered asyn port name.

	addr       [number]   - The asyn address of the parameter.
	
	

**asyn.read** (*portName, addr*)

	Read a string from a given asynOctet port


	portName   [string]   - A registered asyn port name.

	addr       [number]   - The asyn address of the parameter.


	returns a string containing all data read from the asynOctet port until encountering 
	the input terminator set by the global variable InTerminator, or until the timeout set
	by the global variable ReadTimeout is reached.



**asyn.writeread** (*data, portName, addr*)

	Writes data to a port and then reads data from that same port.

	
	portName   [string]   - A registered asyn port name.

	addr       [number]   - The asyn address of the parameter.

	
	returns a string containing all data read from the asynOctet port until encountering 
	the input terminator set by the global variable InTerminator, or until the timeout set
	by the global variable ReadTimeout is reached.
	

**asyn.port** (*portName, addr*)

	Returns a table representing a port object. This object has the functions read
	write, and readwrite, which work the same as the functions above, but the port
	and address need not be specified. The port uses the global in and out terminators
	by default, but has the functions setInTerminator and setOutTerminator to
	change that functionality (as well as getInTerminator and getOutTerminator to 
	query those values). 

	
	portName   [string]   - A registered asyn port name.

	addr       [number]   - The asyn address of the parameter.
	
	
## Epics Functions

**epics.get** (*PV*)
	
	Calls ca_get to retrieve the value of a PV accessible by the host.
	
	
	PV       [string]     - The name of the PV to request.
	
	
	returns the value of the PV given or Nil if the PV cannot be reached.
	
	

**epics.put** (*PV, value*)

	Calls ca_put to set the value of a PV accessible by the host.
	
	
	PV       [string]     - The name of the PV to request.
	
	value    [varies]     - The new value you want to set the PV to. The type of this
	                        parameter should match with the dbtype of the PV requested.
	
	
	
**epics.sleep** (*seconds*)

	Tells the epics thread running the lua script to sleep for a given time.
	
	
	seconds  [number]     - Amount of seconds to sleep for (can be fractional).

	
**epics.pv** (*PV*)

	Returns a table representing a PV object. Index accesses can be used to retrive or 
	change record fields. These changes are completed through ca_get or ca_put.
	
	PV       [string]    - The name of the PV to request.
	
	

## IOC Shell Functions (Epics base 3.15.6 or higher only)

**iocsh.<function_name>** (*arguments...*)

	Searches the list of registered IOC shell functions to find a function with the given
	name. If found, the arguments given are converted to the types that the function expects
	and the function is called.
	
	arguments...   [varies]    - A list of the arguments you would normally use in the IOC shell.

        
## Lua Shell Functions

**shell.loadRegistered** ()

        Loads all registered libraries into the global scope. This is only needed if new libraries 
        have been loaded since the shell has started. Where this happens most frequently would be
        if the lua shell is used as the primary shell and you have just called iocsh.dbLoadDatabase
        to load a database file that contains lua library registrations.
